# Contributing
Thank you for taking the initiative to contribute to this repository! There are a few rules that need to be followed in your pull request in order to be accepted into this repository, which are listed below.

# Rules
- The resource(s) must be open-source ([use the OSI's definition of open-source as a guide](https://opensource.org/osd))
- If a new resource is released (such as a new language model), the old version of that resource must be removed/replaced with the new resource (ex. if Qwen 3 is released, the reference to Qwen 2.5 must be replaced with Qwen 3).
- Items in the list must be sorted alphabetically.
