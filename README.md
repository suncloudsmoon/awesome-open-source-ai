# Awesome Open Source AI [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Awesome Open Source AI is a curated list of useful open-source AI resources, including inference engines, LLMs, and tools. Specifically, this list aims to link to resources that meet the [Open Source InitiativeÂ® (OSI) definition of open source](https://opensource.org/osd) as much as possible.

# Inference Engines

- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) - Barebones LLM inference with additional options to control LLM output beyond those of Ollama.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) - Easy-to-use LLM inference engine offering an OpenAI-compatible API server.
- [OpenedAI Speech](https://github.com/matatonic/openedai-speech) - Great OpenAI-compatible API TTS server that works with Piper TTS, which runs fast on the CPU.

# Language Models

- [Granite 3.1](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/) - Great for RAG and suited for deployment on low-end consumer hardware.
- [Qwen 2.5](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/)[^1] - Best in-class language models that excel in benchmarks for math, etc.

[^1]: The 3B and 72B models are not open-source.

# Embedding Models

- [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) - Great small embedding model perfectly suited for deployment on low-end consumer hardware.

# Image Models
Coming soon...

# Tools

- [LLM Finetuning Script](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomasanderson1962/public-llm-finetuning-script) - A script for finetuning language models based on dataset from the [synthetic dataset generation tool](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomasanderson1962/public-synthetic-dataset-generation-w-internvl2).
- [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) - Provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with local/external language models.
- [Synthetic Dataset Generation w/ InternVL2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomasanderson1962/public-synthetic-dataset-generation-w-internvl2) - A script for generating synthetic datasets from PDF files (using vision instead of text extraction).
- [TextCraft](https://github.com/suncloudsmoon/TextCraft) - Add-in for Microsoft Word with tools for proofreading, text generation, etc.
